# Bondi-Sream
### Bondi-Sream is a video streamer for anything with a browser
## Server
The server for Bondi-stream will only work on MacOS and Linux Windows has so many differences and I don't wanna and can't trust Windows to allow a Windows install if you would like, You are free to make a port to Windows credit is needed.

## Running a Server
 To run a server first install the GitHub repo by opening a terminal and typing in
 ```
git clone https://github.com/HttpAnimation/Bondi-Stream %% cd Bondo-Stream
```
Then after an installation in the same Terminal enter in
```
./Server.sh
```
Now the server is running

## Client
To use the client you will need to know your public IP for this we are going to use
```
192.168.0.249
```
once you know your IP go to another device or the same device and go to [192.168.0.249:2342/](192.168.0.249:2342/) on it then the streamer will be working.
